# Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
In this project we evaluated the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India during three time-periods between 2020 (first wave) and 2021 (second wave). In [study 1](#study1) and [study 2](#study2) we assess the quality in the reporting of surveillance data. In [study 3](#study3) we assess the quality in the reporting of surveillance data, vaccination monitoring data, and vacant bed reporting.

# Study 1 (May 19 - June 1, 2020) <a name="study1"></a>
Transparent and accessible reporting of COVID-19 data is critical for public health efforts. Back in 2020, each Indian state and union territory had its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting had not been systematically evaluated. 

Using WHO's recommendations for reporting COVID-19 surveillance data, and the best practices used in data reporting, we developed a framework with 45 indicators to evaluate the "quality of COVID-19 data reporting" done by the state and union territory governments in India. This framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting â€” availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy.  

We evaluated 29 out of 36 states and union territories in India. Our results showed a large disparity in the quality of reporting across India. For more details please read the paper, [Disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11054-7) published in BMC Public Health. We also have a [Tableau interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/varun.vasudevan1956#!/vizhome/DisparityintheQualityofCOVID-19DataReportingAcrossIndia/CDRS) summarizing this study.

# Study 2 (July 12 - July 25, 2020) <a name="study2"></a>
Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, what was the quality of data reporting in India? We answer this question by evaluating the reporting done by 35 out of 36 states and union territories during July 2020. We compare the findings from this assessment with those from the first study.

# Study 3 (May 22 - June 05, 2021) <a name="study3"></a>

How many men and women have died due to COVID-19 in each state in India? What severe adverse events have been reported following vaccination? Which states are reporting the number of vacant oxygen beds in their hospitals? Such questions have strong public health implications. Is data reporting from the national and subnational governments in India granular enough to answer such questions? We answer that in this paper by documenting and analyzing the reporting of surveillance data, vaccination monitoring data, and bed availability during the second wave of COVID-19.
